Initially, I thought I could do this project by searching on Google for small parts of the project, like learning and doing directly, 
but then I had to change my approach because when coding on the swiftui project, 
its presentation and operation are different from Swift projects so I had to learn the basics of Swiftui from scratch before continuing.

I only code at night and this is my first time coding a swiftui project so the completion speed and results are not too good. I spend about 4-5 hours a day doing it.

There were many problems when I did this project, mostly about the database, I did it using Firestore, not with a realtime database, I had to fix it and that took me a lot of time. 
Next, it's about creating a data structure for the database. I don't have much experience handling these things, i mean about relationships of objects and make decision for the workflow, so I had to change it many times.
The API of firebase not so much clear,so it's cost me lots of time to understand to find the way for solutions, like at the beginning, when i try to learn write data to database, i didnt know write data with nil = delete it,
that's make me think i was wrong about create structure for database until i read the delete section. 
In the project, there is more code than what you asked for. The reason is because I did more functions than the assignment required but then I realized it was not necessary and will cost me lots of times to finish it,
so i remove or freeze those code. I just completed exactly what the Coding Challenge file required. 
I'm still learning more about Swiftui's auto layout, my skills are still weak so I mostly just leave the default settings of the components, that make my app's UI not good looking.
